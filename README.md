My repositories are organized by lists accessible from the Stars button so that the name of the list establishes a hierarchical structure as a folder hierarchical structure with the particularity that a repository belongs to all the lists until reaching the last list in which it is included, the names of the lists are prefixed by a number to achieve this

Please sort the lists by name in ascending order to see the hierarchical structure

In addition to this, the name of the repository is prefixed by the name of the top-level list to which it belongs.
