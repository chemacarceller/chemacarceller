## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My repositories are organized in a hierarchical structure of categories such as a folder hierarchical structure

In addition to this, github lists have been created based on this hierarchical category structure, from which you can also access the different repositories. 
The lists are accessed via the Stars button in the button bar on the home page.
Once accessed the github lists, please sort the lists by name to see the hierarchical structure of categories.

Also the name of the repository is prefixed by the name of the top-level category to which it belongs to be able to identify the repository more easily.

The repository categories are as follows :

* GODOT
     * GODOT-COMPONENTS
          * GODOT-MOVEMENT-COMPONENTS :
              * [Basic Character Movement Component](https://github.com/chemacarceller/GODOT-Basic-Character-Movement-Component)
